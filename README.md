# url_check
Simple python-based command line check of request, using rich inspect


Inspiried by Tim Medin's reply to Jon Gorenflo's tweet about rich (https://twitter.com/TimMedin/status/1363956188975661056), I wrote a very basic script to output the pretty request info.

# Note:
I am not a dev, or a python dev (or really even a github person), but I will try to update this if it's easy. Or you can fork it or pull request, or whatever other magic things people do.
